### Product
HK1 Box S905X3 TV Box

### Product Version:
HK1_X3_S905X3_4BIT_V11_2019-11-05

### Vulnerability Details

The HK1 Box S905X3 TV Box contains a vulnerability that allows a local unprivileged user, such as a malicious APK, to escalate to root using the /system/xbin/su binary. While connected to the device through the serial port (UART), or while using adb as an unprivileged user, the local attacker can execute the /system/xbin/su binary and execute arbitrary code as root, steal social networking account tokens, WiFi passwords, cookies, saved passwords, user location data, message history, emails, or contacts, etc.

A local attacker using adb, or a physical attacker connecting to the device through the UART serial debugging port, is dropped into a shell as the "shell" user without entering a username or password.

Once logged in as the "shell" user, the attacker can escalate to root using the /sbin/su binary which is group executable (750), or /system/xbin/su which is executable by all users (755).

In order to use the device in its intended way, victims are encouraged to sign-in to all of their favorite TV, email, music, and social networking related apps & accounts.

An attacker can steal any social networking account cookies or session tokens, read saved passwords, reveal user location data, emails, message history, contacts, or use the HK1 Box maliciously to sniff other devices on the same network, usually in a home networking environment.

For example, once root, the network WiFi password can be read in plain text at /data/misc/wifi/WifiConfigStore.xml.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Connect via adb or using the UART serial port:

```bash
whoami
# shell

/system/xbin/su
whoami
# root

grep PreSharedKey /data/misc/wifi/WifiConfigStore.xml
# <string name="PreSharedKey">&quot;WIFIPASSWORD&quot;</string>

```

### Protect your HK1 Box

Connect via adb or using the UART serial port:

```bash
whoami
# shell

/system/xbin/su
whoami
# root

chmod 700 /system/xbin/su
chmod 700 /sbin/su

exit
exit

```
