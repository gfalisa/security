### Title
Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor - Brave Browser Potentially Logs The Last Time A Tor Window Was Used.

### CVE ID
CVE-2020-8276

### CVSS Score
Pending

### Internal ID
SICK-2020-013
        
### Vendor
Brave Software, Inc.     
        
### Product
Brave

### Product Version:
1.18.27 and below.
Fixed in 1.18.34

### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability in the Brave Browser allows an attacker to view the last time a Tor session was used in incognito mode. A local, on-disk attacker could read the Brave Browser's "Local State" json file and identify the last time a Tor session was used, affecting the confidentiality of a user's Tor session.

For example, the "Local State" file of a user who has recently used a Tor session would list a key value pair with a timestamp as accurate as "13248493693576042". This allows an attacker to fingerprint, or prove beyond reasonable doubt, that a user was using Tor at that very specific moment in time.

### Vendor Response
Fixed in 1.18.34 Brave Nightly Build, see Pull Request 7010

### PoC

Open Brave Browser in incognito mode with Tor.

Close Brave browser, and view `~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Local State`

```bash
jq '.core_p3a_metrics' < ~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Local\ State
```

```json
{
  "incognito_used_timestamp": "13248495136836403",
  "tor_used": true
}
```

The above timestamp is permanent until overwritten, by another Tor session.

The `tor_used` Boolean refers to whether or not a Tor session has ever been used in Brave Browser, hence the term "potentially" in the report title.

Other metrics related to Tor in `Local State`:

```json
"last_used": "Tor Profile",
"metrics": {
"next_bucket_index": 2
},

```

```json
  "core_p3a_metrics": {
    "incognito_used_timestamp": "13248493693576042",
    "tor_used": true
  },

```

```json
      "Brave.Core.TorEverUsed": {
        "sent": false,
        "timestamp": 0.0,
        "value": "0"
      },

```

```json
  "tor": {
    "tor_disabled": false
  },

```

Proof that `tor_used` Bool only refers to whether has ever used Tor:

- Open icognito with Tor:
```bash
jq '.core_p3a_metrics' < ~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Local\ State
```

```json
{
  "incognito_used_timestamp": "13249022400646476",
  "tor_used": true
}
```

- Open icognito without Tor:
```bash
jq '.core_p3a_metrics' < ~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Local\ State
```

```json
{
  "incognito_used_timestamp": "13249022400646476",
  "tor_used": true
}
```
