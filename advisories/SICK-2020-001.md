### Title
Private Internet Access VPN for Linux - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

### CVE ID
CVE-2020-15590

### CVSS Score
Pending

### Internal ID
SICK-2020-001
        
### Vendor
London Trust Media, Inc         
        
### Product
Private Internet Access VPN Client for Linux

### Product Version:
v1.5 thru 2.3 - Fixed in 2.4.0+

### Vulnerability Details
A vulnerability in the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client for Linux v1.5 through v2.3 allows remote attackers to bypass an intended VPN kill switch mechanism and read sensitive information via intercepting network traffic. Since v1.5, PIA has supported a "split tunnel" OpenVPN bypass option. The PIA killswitch & associated iptables firewall is designed to protect you while using the Internet. When the kill switch is configured to block all inbound and outbound network traffic, privileged applications can continue sending & receiving network traffic if net.ipv4.ip_forward has been enabled in the system kernel parameters. For example, a Docker container running on a host with the VPN turned off, and the kill switch turned on, can continue using the internet, leaking the host IP (CWE 200). In PIA 2.4.0+, policy-based routing is enabled by default and is used to direct all forwarded packets to the VPN interface automatically.

### Vendor Response
Vendor successfully patched CVE-2020-15590 in version 2.4.0+.

# Verify if your configuration is affected

Applications that enable IP forwarding for bridged networking.

E.g.

- Docker
- libvirtd/QEMU, when using bridged networking

```bash
# check if you have enabled ip forwarding
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding
```

Affected output
```bash
# AFFECTED, update to 2.4.0
# net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
# net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0

# AFFECTED, update to 2.4.0
# net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
# net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1

# AFFECTED, update to 2.4.0
# net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
# net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1

# UNAFFECTED, update to 2.4.0
# net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
# net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0

# UNAFFECTED (if no output), update to 2.4.0 anyway


```

# Fix an affected system
#### Update to version 2.4.0 to automatically protect yourself
PIA client for Linux users should immediately update to version 2.4.0


# Manual Fix

The following firewall rules are for users who wish for whatever reason remain on a version below 2.4.0:

## ONLY RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IF YOU DO NOT UPDATE PIA
## YOU DO NOT NEED TO RUN THESE COMMANDS IF YOU UPDATE TO 2.4.0

```bash
#
# ONLY RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IF YOU DO NOT UPDATE PIA
# YOU DO NOT NEED TO RUN THESE COMMANDS IF YOU UPDATE TO 2.4.0
#
# These rules must be reapplied each time the system is started.
# Mark all forwarded packets with a fwmark
iptables -w -A PREROUTING -j MARK --set-mark 0x6789 -t mangle
ip6tables -w -A PREROUTING -j MARK --set-mark 0x6789 -t mangle
# Create a routing table to direct forwarded packets to a specific interface, or blackhole if that interface disappears
# NOTE:
# - Interface route must be recreated if the interface is destroyed (i.e. a VPN tun device that is disconnected)
# - The interface name may differ from tun0
# - If directing to the physical interface instead of the VPN, also specify your gateway
ip route add table 26505 default dev tun0
ip route add table 26505 blackhole default metric 32000 # Leak protection route in case the route above is deleted
ip -6 route add table 26505 default dev tun0
ip -6 route add table 26505 blackhole default metric 32000 # Leak protection route in case the route above is deleted
# Create routing rules to direct forwarded packets to that routing table, while still permitting LAN routes from the main table
ip rule add from all fwmark 0x6789 lookup main suppress_prefixlen 1 prio 2000
ip rule add from all fwmark 0x6789 lookup 26505 prio 2001
ip -6 rule add from all fwmark 0x6789 lookup main suppress_prefixlen 1 prio 2000
ip -6 rule add from all fwmark 0x6789 lookup 26505 prio 2001
```
