### Product Versions:
1.0.5 and below

### Vulnerability Details

Insufficient RegEx in private-ip npm package v1.0.5 and below insufficiently filters reserved IP ranges resulting in indeterminate SSRF. An attacker can perform a large range of requests to ARIN reserved IP ranges, resulting in an indeterminable number of critical attack vectors for server-side projects using private-ip 1.0.5 and below.

The private-ip npm package is a popular server-side package which fails to filter ARIN reserved IP ranges, allowing remote attackers to request server-side resources or potentially execute arbitrary code through various SSRF techniques.

The package is a security package used to attempt to prevent remote requests from reaching internal resources. Implemented RegEx in the v1.0.5 and below insufficiently account for a wide range of variations of localhost, private IP ranges, and IP ranges that are otherwise reserved by ARIN.

### Vendor Response
Patched in version 2.0.0
